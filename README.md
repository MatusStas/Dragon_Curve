# Dragon Curve

It is a fractal with a very simple iterative process:

#### 1.
Draw a Line
#### 2.
Rotate a copy of the Line from Step 1 90 degrees (clockwise or anti-clockwise is arbitrary) and attach it to the end of the First Line. (You will now have two perpendicular lines â€“ an L shape).
#### 3.
Rotate a copy of the entire L shape from Step 2 90 degrees (continue rotating it the same direction as you did in Step 2) and attach it to the end of the First L shape. (You will now have a saucepan shape).
#### 4.
Rotate a copy of the entire saucepan shape from Step 3 90 degrees (continue rotating it the same direction) and attach it to the end of the First saucepan shape.
#### 5.
Rotate a copy of the entire image and attach it to the end of the original.

#### Each step corresponds to the panel in the image below (read from left to right, top to bottom)

#### Here you can see 19th iteration.
